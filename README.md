# Meditation UI Compose
This repository is me following Phillip Lackner's tutorial about Meditation UI using jetpack compose

https://youtu.be/g5-wzZUnIbQ

## What I learned
- I learned how to make a layout from design to composable.
- I learned that composable can be separated so that it can be called many times.
- I learned that Modifier is the backbone of layouting composables.
- I also learned that data class in kotlin is super concise.

I will learn jetpack compose more in the future
